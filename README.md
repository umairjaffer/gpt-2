# **Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Custom Text Generation**
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Fine-tuning allows you to customize the model for specific text generation tasks based on your dataset.

### **Overview**
In this project, you'll learn how to fine-tune GPT-2 on a custom dataset 
We will cover the entire process, including:

* data preprocessing
* training
* evaluating
